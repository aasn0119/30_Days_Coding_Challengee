# Day 1: Largest Element in Array

## Problem Statement

Given an array A[] of size n. The task is to find the largest element in it.

## Instructions

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function largest() which takes the array A[] and its size n as inputs and returns the maximum element in the array.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

- Constraints:
1 <= n<= 103
0 <= A[i] <= 103
Array may contain duplicate elements. 

## Examples

**Example 1:**
Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1, 8, 7, 56, 90}
Output: 90
Explanation: The largest element of given array is 90.

**Example 2:**

Input:
n = 7
A[] = {1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5}
Output: 5
_Explanation_: The largest element of given array is 5.
